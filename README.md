# ðŸš€ Welcome to Dynamic Installer

**Dynamic Installer** is an open-source framework designed to simplify Android customization through a flexible ZIP-based installer. It provides a robust set of utilities for tasks ranging from basic file installation to advanced APK/JAR patching.

Supports both ``Recovery`` and ``Magisk/KSU`` environments.

## Repository

Two branches separate two distinct variants of DI:

- **Main**: Contains shared files common to both variants

- **Standard**:
  
  Optimized for lightweight ZIPs (up to **3.5GB**, using ``unzip``).
- **Z-Variant**
  
  Designed for heavy ROM installations (using ``7zip``).

## How Does It Work?

**DI** uses a simple ZIP structure to package its scripts and tools. Hereâ€™s a basic layout:

```
dynamic_installer.zip
â”œâ”€â”€ META-INF
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ com
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ google
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ android
â”‚   â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ updater-script   # Your Recovery script
â”‚   â”‚           â”œâ”€â”€ update-binary    # Sets up the environment
â”‚   â”‚           â””â”€â”€ magisk           # Magisk space
â”‚   â”‚               â”œâ”€â”€ customize.sh # Your Module script
â”‚   â”‚               â””â”€â”€ module.prop  # Your Module info
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ addons                       # Optional plugins
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ extra.zip                # Extra binaries
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ zbin                         # Internal tools and binaries
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ (tools)
|
â”œâ”€â”€ customize.sh        # It is only provisional for modules
â”œâ”€â”€ module.prop         # KSU / Magisk v28+ module info
|
â””â”€â”€ (your custom files/folders)
```

### Advantages
- Uses **Bash**, instead of DASH/ASH.
- Supports ``Recovery`` and ``Magisk/KSU ``installations with Dual Mode.
- Supports `arm64-v8a` and `armeabi-v7a` architectures.
- Ensure consistent script logic across any device using **standardized mount points** that abstract away differences in device structure (System_root vs. Traditional).
- Simplifies most Android modding scenarios, including reverse engineering of APKs/JARs (at the **Smali** level).
